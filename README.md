# Workout-Adventur
A program that can create a custom exercise program in the form of an RPG for anyone who uses it. I am designing this with personal trainers, and other people who make workout programsm, in mind. This will also be able to be used by anyone ho would like a simple workout routine to meet their needs

# Process
The python program inside this repository currently is an example that I was able to get to run after changing some things in theoriginal code. The original author was using some sort of library file on his PC that I don't have access to. So I had to make the program no longer need to use the information on that file.


# Languages used
- Python

# ToDo
- [] Get code to run
- [] Add more detail to sample code
- [] Update repository with changes to code
- [] Complete original application
